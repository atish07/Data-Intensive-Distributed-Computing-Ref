    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some graph analysis, using a graph of the Gnutella server network.   In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n",
    "For example, this line:\n",
    "> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n",
    "\n",
    "gives the adjacency list for server `91`.   It indicates that there are edges from server `91` to servers `243`, `1923`, and `2194`.    According to the Stanford Network Analysis Project, which collected these data, [the graph includes 6301 servers and 20777 edges](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/p2p-Gnutella08.html).\n",

    "- How many nodes and edges are there in the graph?  (This should confirm the numbers given above.)\n",
    "- How many nodes of each outdegree are there? That is, how many nodes have no outgoing edges, how many have one outgoing edge, how many have two outgoing edges, and so on?\n",

    "Your main objective for this assignment is to perform *single source personalized page rank* over the Gnutella graph.  To get started, you should make sure that you have a clear understanding of ordinary (i.e., non-personalized) page rank.  Read the description of page rank in Section 5.3 of [the course textbook](http://mapreduce.cc/).   Personalized page rank is like ordinary page rank except:\n",
    "- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node. Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n",
    "- Personalized page rank is initialized by assigning all probability mass to the source node, and none to the other nodes. In contrast, ordinary page rank is initialized by giving all nodes the same probability mass.\n",
    "- Whenever personalized page rank makes a random jump, it jumps back to the source node. In contrast, ordinary page rank may jump to any node.\n",
    "- In personalized page rank, all probability mass lost dangling nodes is put back into the source nodes.  In ordinary page rank, lost mass is distributed evenly over all nodes.\n",

    "The output of your function should be a list of the 10 nodes with the highest personalized page rank with respect to the given source. For each of the 10 nodes, return the node's id and page rank value as a tuple. The list returned by the function should therefore look something like this: `[(node_id_1, highest_pagerank_value), ..., (node_id_10, 10th_highest_pagerank_value)]`"

($p_0(x)$ is the initial probability mass of node $x$.)   We define the change of $x$'s probability mass on the $i$th iteration as $\\lvert p_i(x)-p_{i-1}(x) \\rvert$.   Then, we can iterate personalized page rank until the maximum (over all nodes) change is less than a specified threshold, i.e, until all nodes' page ranks have converged.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spark provides the ability to *cache* RDDs.   This is useful when an RDD will be used more than once.   Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question, go back to the code that you wrote to answer Question 3, and add caching.   (Caching will not affect the functionality of your code, i.e., what it computes.   It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to adding `cache()` calls in your code, use the text cell below to briefly explain how you decided which RDDs to cache. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were not able to finish Question 3, add caching annotations to your solution for Question 2 instead."

    "#### Importance of Caching\n",
    "I am caching the rdd(graph_data) which stores the structure of the graph. This is because it is the only thing which is invariant to any change during different iterations. As Pyspark uses lazy execution and in memory processing therefore it is very important to store those things in cache which are oftenly used but change seldomly. Cache such rdds enhances the performance significantly.\n"
